# 🐾 Waggle Device Data Analysis – Pet Activity & Satisfaction Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard analyzes data from Waggle, a pet activity tracking device, comparing usage and performance across cats and dogs from 2018 to 2020. The dashboard provides insights into pet behavior (e.g., daily steps, age), device satisfaction ratings, household demographics, breed breakdowns, and financial factors such as pet-related expenses and income. 

It supports product improvement and marketing strategies by highlighting how customer satisfaction varies by pet type and demographics.

## 💼 Skills Demonstrated

### 📊 Power BI Dashboard Development
- Designed a multi-page, interactive Power BI dashboard.
- Implemented filters and slicers for time, device type, pet type, and geography.
- Created intuitive charts such as time series (steps by month/year), maps, and satisfaction distributions.

### 🔍 Comparative Analysis
- Conducted a comparative study of **Lapcat vs. Lapdog** devices across metrics such as:
  - Average daily steps (Dogs: up to 15K vs. Cats: ~2.8K)
  - Device ratings (Dogs: 4.69 vs. Cats: 1.64)
- Used visuals to highlight the behavioral and satisfaction differences between pet types.

### 🧬 Customer Segmentation & Behavioral Trends
- Segmented device usage by:
  - **Pet age**
  - **Breed** (e.g., Golden Retriever, Bulldog, Corgi)
  - **Gender**
- Identified ownership patterns and behavior by household size and state.

### 💸 Financial Insights
- Visualized **average annual pet expenses** by animal type and years of ownership.
- Compared **household income** by state, connecting financial data to pet ownership trends.

### 📈 Data Aggregation & Temporal Analysis
- Aggregated pet activity and satisfaction data across **3 years (2018–2020)**.
- Performed seasonal and monthly trend analysis to detect behavioral patterns over time.

### 💡 Insight Generation
- Determined that dog owners are significantly more satisfied with activity trackers than cat owners.
- Identified opportunities for product improvement for cat devices (Lapcat).
- Provided demographic breakdowns useful for targeting marketing campaigns.
